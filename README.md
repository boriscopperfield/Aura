# Project AURA: An AI-Native Meta-OS

AURA is an AI-native meta-operating system that fundamentally reimagines how humans interact with computational systems. Rather than forcing users to decompose their intentions into primitive operations, AURA accepts high-level, ambiguous goals and autonomously orchestrates complex workflows to achieve them.

## Core Philosophy

AURA is built on three pillars:
1. **Event Log as Immutable Truth**: All system state is a deterministic projection of the event log
2. **Workspace as Tangible State**: File structure mirrors logical organization for transparency
3. **Decoupled Cognition**: Task execution is cleanly separated from learning

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install the package
pip install -e .

# Run AURA
aura --help
```

## System Architecture

AURA consists of several key components:
- **AURA Kernel**: Command Handler, Planner AI, Transaction Manager
- **Storage Layer**: Event Log, Task Workspace, Git Repository
- **Memory System**: Memory Graph, Vector Indexes, Cognitive Services
- **Execution Layer**: Task Executor, Agent Manager, Agent Pool
- **Event Distribution**: Event Bus

## Development Status

This project is currently in active development based on the v4.0 specification.
